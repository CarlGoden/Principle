	An analysis of operating system based on xv6-riscv

0: Interrupt & Exception & Trap:

	Interrupt is asynchronous, Exception is synchronous. Trap can either interrupt or exception.
	
	Hardware interrupt is external device signal (timer, uart, disk, etc).
	Software interrupt is usually used to custom hardware interrupt handler.
	For example, a hardware timer handler can update date the system time in machine mode, and then
	transform that interrupt by creating a software interrupt by which to awake the sleeping process.

		  mtvec/stvec/utvec: handler

		  mret/sret: return
		  mepc/sepc: return address
		  mcause/scause
	
	User interrupt is syscall, supervisor interrupt is device interrupt,
	machine interrupt is timer. Although timer is also a device, it is
	the most important device since it is the only mechanism to interrupt
	a malfunction. Even divide-by-zero is interrupt caused by cpu, it is
	also only a supervisor interrupt.
	
	At first in entry.S, it first read mhartid, and based that id alloc a 4K
	stack for every hart and set stack pointer sp to it.
	Then it call start in which it set main function as epc to be called after
	mret. and then it init the timer to set the timerver as the only mtvec.
	
	1) Read mhartid
	2) Alloc 4K stack for every hart and set the stack pointer sp.
	3) call start to init machine mode
	4) call main to init
	5) call scheduler
	
1: Context Switch in swtch.S

	Store current context which contains ra, sp and callee-saved s0 - s11.
	and load to-run process's constext to its pertaining registers.

2: SpinLock & SleepLock

	struct spinlock {
		int locked;
		struct cpu *cpu;
	}

	method: init, acquire, release, holding

3: System Call

	Befor call "ECALL", user put syscall's arguments on a0 - a6. a7 is implicitly
	call number which is defined in syscall.h.
	
	ECALL will induce exception.
	
4: Interrupt Handler

	csrw mtvec, timervec  // defined in kernelvec.S, called in start::timerinit
	csrw stvec, kernelvec // defined in kernelvec.S, called in trap::usertrap
