	Math

The core of mathematic is to combine the abstract model with the material
and by linking the most of abstract models to uncover the reality of world.
A common error-prone point-of-view is the abstract model is unalignmented,
unrecognizable, unacceptable in intuition. This is a question of intuition
but not the mathematic model. Since intuition is always the first expression
or a long wrong history of bounded thinking.

The key of an algorithm is to find its fixed point. The fixed point is
a structure property which belongs to the algebra branch of mathematics.
