recursive descent parser:

  LL(n): look ahead n tokens, L1: read the input from left to right
                              L2: decent into parse-tree children from left to right

         左递归, eg r: r X;

  Backtracking: 试错回返 specutive & rewind, use memoizing for perfomance

  Predicated: context-sensitive, is P(X) true of flase
